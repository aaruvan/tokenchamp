## Mock/Placeholder Features (MVP)

### NFT Minting
- ⚠️ Mock NFT minting (returns mock token IDs)
- ⚠️ Placeholder metadata URI (not uploaded to IPFS/Arweave)
- ⚠️ Simulated transaction signatures

**To implement real minting:**
```python
# Replace mock in backend/solana_service.py with actual Metaplex integration
from metaplex import create_nft
# Implement actual Solana transaction signing
```

### Image Storage
- ⚠️ Badge images via external URLs (no upload functionality)
- ⚠️ No image validation or processing

**To implement:**
- Add file upload endpoint
- Integrate with IPFS (Pinata, NFT.Storage) or Arweave
- Implement image validation and optimization

### Wallet Integration
- ⚠️ Manual wallet address paste (no wallet connection)
- ⚠️ No wallet signature verification

**To implement:**
- Integrate Phantom wallet adapter
- Add Solflare support
- Implement wallet signature for authentication
